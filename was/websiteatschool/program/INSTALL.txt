Quick Install of Website@School
===============================

1. Download the latest distribution version of Website@School
   (either as a .ZIP-file or a tar.gz-file.), e.g. from
   <http://download.websiteatschool.eu> or directly from JoinUp.

2. Unpack the distribution file somewhere on your webserver,
   e.g. in /home/httpd/htdocs. This will yield a number of files
   (index.php, admin.php, etc.) in the CURRENT directory.
   Also, a subdirectory 'program' with all the other program
   files will be created.

3. (optional but recommended) Install the Website@School Manual:

   3A. Download the latest version of the Website@School Manual
       (either as a .ZIP-file or a tar.gz-file.), e.g. from 
       <http://download.websiteatschool.eu> or directly from JoinUp.

   3B. Unpack the manual file in the same place as you did unpack
       the distribution file in step 2 above.

4. Start the installation process by pointing your browser to
   'program/install.php' and follow the directions.

5. Your new website is ready.


Quick Upgrade of Website@School
===============================

1. Download the latest distribution version of Website@School
   (either as a .ZIP-file or a tar.gz-file.), e.g. from
   <http://download.websiteatschool.eu> or directly from JoinUp.

2. Unpack the distribution file in the same place on your webserver
   as you did before, e.g. in /home/httpd/htdocs. This will yield
   a number of files (index.php, admin.php, etc.) in the CURRENT
   directory. Also, a subdirectory 'program' with all the other
   program files will be created. Note: the new version is supposed
   to overwrite the existing version.

3. (optional but recommended) Install or update the Website@School
   Manual, by downloading the latest version and unpacking the file
   in the same directory you used before (see step 2).

4. Surf to the admin.php file and login. If you are not redirected
   to the Update Manager please do so manually, using the Tools menu.

   system needs to be updated. Please follow that link. After this
   update the status should change to 'OK'.

5B.Please follow the other links (if any) in the Status column
   until every item has the status 'OK'.
