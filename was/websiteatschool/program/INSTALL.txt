Quick Install of Website@School
===============================

1. Download the latest distribution version of Website@School
   (either as a .ZIP-file or a tar.gz-file.).

   in the CURRENT directory. Also, a subdirectory 'program'
   with all the other program files will be created.

3. Start the installation process by pointing your browser to
   'program/install.php' and follow the directions.

4. Your new website is ready.
