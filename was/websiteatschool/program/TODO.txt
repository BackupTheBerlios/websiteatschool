-- convert /program/*.txt to DOS-text
-- decide on exact license conditions

2008-02-01
-- add an explanation to the manual about $CFG->datadir within the
   document root and a 'difficult' name that cannot be guessed.

2008-02-07
OK should we document $CFG->debug? this is a feature that is handy
   during development, but it should be 'off' on a production server
   Answer: this is now documented.
-- how can we discriminate between a call from the command line and
   a call via a web interface? Is it a mere check of
   $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']? (You _never_ have a remote address when
   working from the command line, do you?). Would be handy in case
   of cron.php.

2008-02-14
-- make a separate subtree for testing purposes. I don't think that
   that test environment should be published for end users (but it
   should be for developers). Maybe a subdirectory /devel/test/ and
   a corresponding /devel/test/test.php?

2008-02-19
-- can it be possible to have a page visible in navigation and not
   available to serve? I'm inclined to say yes: if a node only has
   a href, no actual data is available in the database. However,
   should we treat this as a call nevertheless and count the page
   view just before we redirect via header()? Mmm....

2008-03-22
OK Protect password fields with AUTOCOMPLETE="off" (see
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Authentication)
OK Count the number of failed login-attempts within a certain
   period of time
OK On-time password reset should time out in a short time, e.g.
   15 minutes (ok, make it 30 minutes)
OK Should there be password requirements (min 1 digit, min 1 capital,
   minimum length?): YES one of each.
OK Add delay in user validation (3 seconds per attempt)
OK Should login-forms have short-lived unique identifiers?
   (prevents brute force attacks?) Methinks that our blacklist
   facility (8 minutes after more than 10 failed attempts) is enough.

2008-04-25
-- Add to cronjobs: cleanup of expired sessions + logging of the fact
OK Should we add the number of calls + length of session in seconds to
   the logout message? What then if the session expires without a
   proper logoff? A: added this for reqular logouts
-- Add to cron: removal of obsolete login_failures? It should be
   auto-cleaning but if a user fails once and never returns, the
   failure will be there forever.
OK Get rid of the 'trigger_error()' calls now that we have logger(),
   maybe except errors in the database routines..
-- Logrotate for log_messages table? How? Send a summary to the
   webmaster before deletion?

2008-04-27
-- we should be able to optimise with relative links (sometimes) if
   the hostname part of $CFG->www and $CFG->progwww are the same.
   Example: when pointing to the source of an image the src would
   be {$CFG->progwww}/graphics/foo.png, i.e. including the
   'http://www.exemplum.websiteatschool.org' part. If $CFG->www
   also starts with that string, we can leave it out in the src
   property: src="/program/graphics/foo.png".

   Here is a generic example fromt RFC3986:

         foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment

   If $CFG->www and $CFG->progwww have the same scheme and
   authority, links could be made relative, e.g.
   <a href="/over/there/?name=ferret#nose"> and 
   <img src="/over/there/program/graphics/ferret.jpg"> instead
   of prefixing with an explicit "foo://example.com:8042/".
   What if the scheme and authority are NOT the same?

2008-05-01
-- About the installer: if the installer is not able to write
   'config.php' to the target directory, it should be possible to
   'download' a .ZIP-file with this config.php, and perhaps also
   with index.php, cron.php, admin.php? Unzip that in the appropriate
   place and you are in business.

2008-08-01
-- How about storing ETags and be friendly to caches/proxies?
-- How about using index.php/aaa/nnn/friendly-title-of-page-for-bookmark
   instead of index.php?area=aaa&node=nnn
   That too is cache/proxy-friendly...

2008-09-29
OK How about adding an extra parameter to manual.php in order to
   'deep link' to the manual? Example: if the user has selected
   the pagemanager in admin.php, should the help button be calling
   'manual.php?language=en&job=pagemanager' or something?
   Done: additional parameter 'topic' is added, at least from page
   manager. Could be employed from start centre too if necessary.

2008-10-01

-- Should there be an attribute 'is_root' or 'is_guru' in the users
   table? E.g. if a node is owned by some user, only that user is
   allowed to remove the read-only bit. Shouldn't there be a way
   to override that other than by using phpMyAdmin to manipulate
   the database directly?

2008-10-10
-- Edit permissions not only depend on the user's permission bits but
   also on the read-only attribute of a node.
-- We should isolate the check-permission routines becaust they are
   used when creating icons and also when executing the corresponding
   function.
 
2008-10-20
-- get some decent graphics for button_save and button_cancel and other
   buttons...

2008-10-28
OK How about changing all where clauses with "(value = 'NULL')" into
   "(value IS NULL)" to be more SQL-standard compliant? Done, in
   databaselib.php and function db_where_clause().
-- So how about recovering from a crashed browser with an inaccessible
   session? It is very annoying to be locked out in the cold if the
   browser crashed and I immediately login again using the same
   credentials and still not be able to carry on...
   Should we add the time of the lock, too? That would give the other
   user an educated guess about the odds that the other session is
   still active. Mmmmm...

2008-11-12
-- the output object AdminOutput should have something like a 'funnel
   mode'. This mode should disable all navigation links and other
   links that could distract and/or seduce the user to leave the
   page. Main use: prevent locked records hanging around without
   the user actively editing that record.
   

2008-11-20
-- the Theme should have a property 'date/time last modified' so
   a module can update it via module_view().
-- how to create an alert based on edit content (or not)? How
   can we tell that the content actually changed? Is there a
   'dirty' bit somewhere? Should we return a status insted of
   simply true/false?

2008-12-10
-- How about the visibility of nodes when in preview mode?????

2009-02-25
-- do we actually _USE_ the field muser_id in the page manager? 
   we do in the area manager.

2009-02-26
-- How about adding transactions (rollback, commit)
   See function that deletes areas.
   Q: How well is MySQL suited for transactions?
   A: Mmmmm.... Which version? Which storage engine? 

2009-05-31
-- Why not use the 'name' field in the dialogdef[] arrays?
   $dialogdef = array('fullname' => array('name' => 'fullname',
   'type' => F_STRING, ...)); Much more convenient when saving
   data.
-- Doublecheck for htmlspecialchars() when displaying information
   from the database in a dialog: a username like say
   '<u>ser</u>name' should be converted to 
   '&lt;u&gt;ser&lt;/u&gt;name' before being sent to the browser.

2009-06-04
-- we should re-analyse the repercussions of the option to delete
   user accounts. If only the user_id is logged, it is difficult
   to figure out whodunnit if the account has already disappeared,
   not to mention breaking the constraint of the foreign key.
   This is also a problem for tables with cuser_id and muser_id...

2009-09-22
-- We should have a graphics designer restyle all icons etc.
   I'm no good at that.

2009-12-04
-- Should we make the permissions 0700 configurable, eg in
   areamanager?

2010-09-27
-- There is a potential security issue with relative paths:
   the check on '/../' is inconclusive if the $path is encoded in UTF-8: the overlong
   sequence 2F C0 AE 2E 2F eventually yields 2F 2E 2E 2F or '/../'.
   Reference: RFC3629 section 10. Applies to main_file.php and also
   filemanager.class.php.

2010-12-08
-- Should we add a configuratble favicon to themes as a config option
   (defaulting to /program/graphics/favicon.ico)?
