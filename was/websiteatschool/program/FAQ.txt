This file will contain answers to frequently asked questions.

Q1: Can I temporarily close my website?
A1: Yes. If a file called 'maintenance.html' exists in the top
    level directory (i.e. the directory holding the main entry
    points and also the file 'config.php'), a website visitor
    will be redirected to that file 'maintenance.html' instead
    of the real site.

Q2: What is this message "condition code 010"?
A2: It means that the site is not yet configured. Point your
    browser to /program/install.php to start the installation
    wizard and follow the instructions.

Q3: What is "condition code 050"?
A3: This indicates that the version of the program (the .PHP-files)
    is not the same as the structure of the database. Usually this
    means that an update needs to be done in the database, changing
    the database structure.
