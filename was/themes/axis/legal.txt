This theme uses an image derived from a painting by Paulus Potter (1646) called
"Peasant Family with Animals". On April 4, 2012 the full image was retrieved from
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paulus_Potter_Bauernfamilie_m_Vieh.jpg.

This page states the following.

  "This is a faithful photographic reproduction of an original
  two-dimensional work of art. The work of art itself is in the public
  domain for the following reason: Public domain This work is in the
  public domain in the United States, and those countries with a
  copyright term of life of the author plus 100 years or fewer.

  The official position taken by the Wikimedia Foundation is that
  "faithful reproductions of two-dimensional public domain works of art
  are public domain, and that claims to the contrary represent an
  assault on the very concept of a public domain". For details, see
  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:When_to_use_the_PD-Art_tag

  This photographic reproduction is therefore also considered to be in
  the public domain. Please be aware that depending on local laws,
  re-use of this content may be prohibited or restricted in your
  jurisdiction."
